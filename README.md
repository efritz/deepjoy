A Go library that wraps [garyburd/redigo](https://github.com/garyburd/redigo/redis)
in a pool. This library is named after [Y-40](http://www.y-40.com/en/).

## Example

First, instantiate a client with any of hte following optional config functions.
The only required parameter is the address of the remote Redis server - all other
values have sane (hopefully) defaults.

```go
client := NewClient(
    "http://dart.it.corp:6379",
    WithPassword("hunter2"),
    WithDatabase(3),
    WithConnectTimeout(time.Second * 5),
    WithReadTimeout(time.Second * 5),
    WithWriteTimeout(time.Second * 5),
    WithBorrowTimeout(time.Second * 5),
    WithPoolCapacity(10),
    WithBreaker(overcurrent.NewCircuitBreaker()),
    WithLogger(NewLogAdapter()),
)

// Drain the pool
defer client.Close()
```

Password, database, connect, read, and write timeouts are sent directly to the
backing redis library. The borrow timeout setting is used to determine how much
time we will spend waiting on an *empty* pool before returning a no connection
error back to the user. 

The breaker is an instance of an [overcurrent](https://github.com/efritz/overcurrent)
circuit breaker and is invoked when dialing a new redis connection. If dials are
failing very rapidly, it is best to back off on the consumer side to let the remote 
service recover.

A logger is a simple interface with a single Printf function. By default, the
logger will call `log.Printf`. `NewNilLogger` will return a silent logger. If
your application uses a more sophisticated (structured) logging library, a small
shim can be created so that it conforms to this protocol.

The client API is otherwise minimal. You can run a redis command, which consists of
a single string command and a following variadic list of interfaces composing the
command's arguments as follows.

```go
result, err := client.Do("hmset", "myhash", "f1", "Hello", "f2", 14)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

// parse interface{} result
```

In order to run multiple commands in a single round trip, you can use a transaction.
This method takes a set of `Command` instances, which are a simple structure that wraps
the same command and variadic list of args as shown above.

```go
result, err := client.Transaction(
    NewCommand("set", "mykey", "myavlue"),
    NewCommand("expire", "mykey"),
)

if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

// parse interface{} result
```
